- Don't commit build related directories like 'target'.

- There are many specific exceptions thrown by 'main' method. I mean
  you have let many of inner exceptions get to the surface of your
  app. Should all of them reach here? I think they can be converted
  to a set of more meaningful exceptions which they are defined in 
  the domain that you are writing code about.
  Since most of them are Java exceptions, there is no issue. But
  if you throw an exception which is defined in one of your 
  dependencies or implementations, you'll be in problem.

- Usually, there is no 'interfaces' package. All interfaces are assumed
  core concepts and they are placed in the root package.

- Class names should start with capital letter.

- Extra questions about your implementation will be asked in class.
